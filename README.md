# Fastest-Integer-Sort
These are generalised functions written in C++ which are highly optimised for integer based array or vector sorting. It is 6 times faster than C++ STL std::sort for "int array[10000000]"

"ir_sort" is the name of the function to sort the integer based arrays.
Currently sorts the input in ascending order only.
Usage: to use the function "ir_sort", paste the following lines in the start of the file and copy the three files to the same folder
       #include "integer_sort.cpp"
       
TODO:
1. add option to sort the array in descending order
2. write the function to sort the array of objects based on integers in ascending and descending order
